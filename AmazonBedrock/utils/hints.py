It's helpful to break this exercise down to several steps.								
1.	Modify the initial prompt template so that Claude writes two poems.							
2.	Give Claude indicators as to what the poems will be about, but instead of writing in the subjects directly (e.g., dog, cat, etc.), replace those subjects with the keywords "{ANIMAL1}" and "{ANIMAL2}".							
3.	Run the prompt and make sure that the full prompt with variable substitutions has all the words correctly substituted. If not, check to make sure your {bracket} tags are spelled correctly and formatted correctly with f-string brackets."""

exercise_6_1_hint = """The grading function in this exercise is looking for the correct categorization letter + the closing parentheses and the first letter of the name of the category, such as "C) B" or "B) B" etc.
Let's take this exercise step by step:										
1.	How will Claude know what categories you want to use? Tell it! Include the four categories you want directly in the prompt. Be sure to include the parenthetical letters as well for easy classification. Feel free to use XML tags to organize your prompt and make clear to Claude where the categories begin and end.									
2.	Try to cut down on superfluous text so that Claude immediately answers with the classification and ONLY the classification. There are several ways to do this, from speaking for Claude (providing anything from the beginning of the sentence to a single open parenthesis so that Claude knows you want the parenthetical letter as the first part of the answer) to telling Claude that you want the classification and only the classification, skipping the preamble.
Refer to Chapters 2 and 5 if you want a refresher on these techniques.							
3.	Claude may still be incorrectly categorizing or not including the names of the categories when it answers. Fix this by telling Claude to include the full category name in its answer.)								
4.	Be sure that you still have {email} somewhere in your prompt template so that we can properly substitute in emails for Claude to evaluate."""

1.	Try to have at least two example emails. Claude doesn't need an example for all categories, and the examples don't have to be long.

XML tags will help you separate out your examples from the rest of your prompt, although it's unnecessary.									
2.	Make sure your example answer formatting is exactly the format you want Claude to use, so Claude can emulate the format as well. This format should make it so that Claude's answer ends in the letter of the category. Wherever you put the {email} placeholder, make sure that it's formatted exactly like your example emails.

(A)In general
The term "qualified employee" means any individual who—

(ii)agrees in the election made under this subsection to meet such requirements as are determined by the Secretary to be necessary to ensure that the withholding requirements of the corporation under chapter 24 with respect to the qualified stock are met.</quotes>

<answer>According to the provided documentation, a "qualified employee" is defined as an individual who:

1. Is not an "excluded employee" as defined in the documentation.
2. Agrees to meet the requirements determined by the Secretary to ensure the corporation's withholding requirements under Chapter 24 are met with respect to the qualified stock.</answer>

First, gather quotes in <quotes></quotes> tags that are relevant to answering the user's question. If there are no quotes, write "no relevant quotes found".
